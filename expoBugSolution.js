The solution to this issue was multi-faceted.  First, I ensured that all my project dependencies were up-to-date using `npm update` or `yarn upgrade`.  If that didn't solve the problem, I performed a clean install using `npm install --force` or `yarn install --force`. This ensures the removal of any corrupted package files or configurations which may be impacting the server. Finally, since there were still no useful error messages, I consulted the system logs in my OS to see if there was any clue regarding low memory, CPU usage spikes, or any other system events that could be causing the crash. The log files provide valuable insights. In some rare cases, reinstalling node or restarting the machine also might be a solution.
