# Intermittent Expo CLI Development Server Crash

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered with the Expo CLI where the development server crashes without providing any helpful error messages in the console. The crash is intermittent and seems to be specific to the development environment, as the project works fine on other machines.

## Bug Description

The Expo development server crashes randomly. No error messages or logs are provided to aid in debugging. The project builds and runs successfully on other machines, indicating the issue is localized to the environment.

## Solution

The solution involves checking for outdated dependencies, performing a clean installation, and inspecting the system logs for any potential clues. These actions are described in the `expoBugSolution.js` file and are likely to be more helpful in the case of this error.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the Expo development server: `expo start`
4. Observe the server crashing intermittently without error messages.

## Troubleshooting

In the case of the intermittent server crash without error messages, one can often find additional information by looking at the system logs. The system logs (specific path differs based on your operating system) can provide insights into any system-level issues interfering with the server's operation. The logs are often helpful to reveal crashes that are not reported by the Expo CLI.
